A command line program to print lines in a text file which contains a specific string 
Built by following the [tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html)

![Running Oxidogrep to find instance of the string "to" [This time case insensitive] in A poem]
(https://github.com/higgsboson1209/OxidoGrep/blob/main/Images/Case_insensitive.png)

Some basic Features that have been implemented 
*Case insensitive search in file 
*Error Handling 

Features I will be adding as I learn more Rust 
*Grep for Multiple Files 
*Parallel Processing to perform search faster on these multiple files
